# TSC Settings menu

This project is part of the Toon thermostat mod created bij the TSC team. It will add a TSC button to the settings menu in which a few mods can be enabled/disabled or changed.
The app can only work in conjuction with the modded resource files (needed from 4.16.* firmware and on) provided by the TSC team.

The app also installs a helper script which will run from inittab. This script listens to commands from the app so it can update resource files, flush firewall rules and any other future usefull command line stuff.
